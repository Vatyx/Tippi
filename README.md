## Notes

I implemented the first responder in the project but not the gif. When I make the text field a first responder it moves the characters already in the text field down and doesn't make it look right. I wasn't able to find out what was wrong with it.

The screen tearing from the Virtual Machine I was running it on. Since I have a windows it had to be developed on a VM but in order to resolve the tearing, I'm going to reinstall the VM and fix it for the Assignment 1.
